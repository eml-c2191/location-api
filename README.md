## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Postgres

Install postgre following guide : https://www.w3schools.com/postgresql/postgresql_install.php
Project enable DATABASE_SYNCHRONIZE so as long as you have postgre installed on your machine then it good to go.

## Create file .env, copy and paste below string into it.
```bash
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD={your password}
DATABASE_NAME=postgres
DATABASE_SCHEMA=public
DATABASE_SYNCHRONIZE=true
```
## Put file .env in same hierarchy with src folder

## Knows issue

- Reading file local.env not working when start with NodeEnv = local

## What have been done 

- Self-logger : All applications are using a logger, there are plenty of loggers, for example, cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, …)use different loggers. Moreover, change your logger can be painful.
It is for this reason, I‘m using a module with an interface to abstract this problem to my logic and be no dependant on the cloud provider or an npm module.
- The logic is the same as the logger module. To avoid exception errors related to a specific Provider or Nodejs framework. I abstract the service.
- environment config for reading file .env
- Apply Clean Architecture
- API CRUD location
- Filter which is A middleware to catch errors in the code. It is not related to the requirement but it will help me get more info in the debugg process
- Interceptor to return a formatted response and gets a harmony for all response.
- Module Usecases proxy: 
   link between use cases and infrastructure, you will inject different services needed for your use cases. 
   In this way, it will be easy to change service in the future and you respect the dependency injection (SOLID)
- Handling exception by using global exception filter. I also have Exception Module to use in case we want to self-handle others case
- Validate input using  class-validator.
- Validate basic case for get, update and delete  action

## What I will do next 
- try to fix known issue
- implement authentication using jwt

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
